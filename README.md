# TFM: Construction of a neural network model of the granular layer using the pycabnn tool 

You can find here the different files generated by pycabnn for a granular layer model with dimensions:

300 um x 300 um x 86 um

- Files of generated positions for GoC, Glo, GrC and MF, e.g. "GCcoordinates.dat".
- Files of generated connections (txt and hdf5 files), e.g "GLtoGCsources" and "AAtoGoC.h5".

You can also find the list of parameters in file params.hoc.

- params.hoc

Finally, we add part of the analisys carried out to determine if the model can be considered as biologically plausible:

- Resultados.ipynb + images/plots
